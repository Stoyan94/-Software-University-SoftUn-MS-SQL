An alter ego (Latin for "other I") means an alternate self, which is believed to be distinct from a person's normal or true original personality. 
Finding one's alter ego will require finding one's other self, one with a different personality. 
Additionally, the altered states of the ego may themselves be referred to as alterations.



A distinct meaning of alter ego is found in the literary analysis used when referring to fictional literature and other narrative forms, 
describing a key character in a story who is perceived to be intentionally representative of the work's author (or creator), 
by oblique similarities, in terms of psychology, behavior, speech, or thoughts, often used to convey the author's thoughts. 
The term is also sometimes, but less frequently, used to designate a hypothetical "twin" or "best friend" to a character in a story. Similarly, 
the term alter ego may be applied to the role or persona taken on by an actor[1] or by other types of performers.
