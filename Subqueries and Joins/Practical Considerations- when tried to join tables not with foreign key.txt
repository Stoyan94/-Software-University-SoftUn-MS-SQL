Practical Considerations
Performance: Joining on non-key columns or arbitrary conditions can lead to large, inefficient queries, especially without proper indexing.
Data Integrity: Ensuring joins are made on correct logical relationships or foreign keys helps maintain data integrity and produce meaningful results.
Debugging: Mistakes in join conditions can be hard to debug, leading to unexpected and incorrect query results.
In summary, joining tables without using foreign keys is possible, but it should be done with an understanding of the data and the logical relationship between columns to ensure meaningful and efficient results.
